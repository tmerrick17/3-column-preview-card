## My process

With the HTML basic content provided, worked on:
  - assigning CSS class names using the BEM method
  - used SASS (7-1 file structure, I only needed to use 4 modular folders in tis project)
  - creating variables in SASS for color schemes, fonts, font-sizes, etc
  - adding Google Fonts provided
  - reset CSS to give all browsers a common starting point

Next worked on:
  - built mobile first
  - Figuring out where to use Flex vs Grid (used both)
  - Worked on media query for tablet/desktop

Finally worked on:
  - Worked on accessibility features on buttons and footer links

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Sass custom variables
- Sass modular structure 
- CSS Flex & Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I did a lot of research using the [Sass modular structure](https://sass-guidelin.es) (7-1 pattern).  While this project probably didn't need this structure I wanted to practice using it for eventually bigger projects.  I took to it pretty quickly and it was enjoyable to figure out and use.

### Continued development

Eventually when appropriate I want to really tackle @mixins and @functions.  I also want to work with the clamp() property on responsive text sizes based on the viewport.

### Useful resources

- [Kevin Powell](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCJZv4d5rbIKd4QHMPkcABCw) - I watch his videos over and over again for great CSS/Sass tips and tricks.
